## actual issues
- if there is actual issues with this project just make a new issue without the "bio-creation" label and a page wont be created for it
- - any other features just make a pr and ill review it once i see it,
 
## future plans
- add pfps,
- add markdown support,
- make the layout better
- login system with github to change live (so when you click save it sends a issue to update it)
- get more people using it
