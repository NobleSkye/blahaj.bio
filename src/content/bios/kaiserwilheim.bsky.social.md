  Hi yall, this is a much more longer variation of my profile on Bluesky. I was
  a TWATter shitposter, I left because of personal reasons, I do like history,
  yes, and I am a goober cause I am silly. I do have transformers that I play
  with. And yes, I do play MGS3. Sane with Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 (The best
  game).
